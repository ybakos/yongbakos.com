<h1>Sister Sadie (by Horace Silver)</h1>
<p>In a nutshell: a brisk, 32-bar, AABA blues in D.</p>
<h2>Background (who is Sister Sadie?)</h2>
<p>&quot;Sister Sadie&quot; is from down home. Horace relates that Coltrane, when he heard the group play it in Philly, said to him, &quot;What's the name of that 'amen' number you're playing?&quot; (original liner notes of <i>Blowin the Blues Away</i>, Blue Note 84017)</p>
<p>&quot;Sister Sadie,&quot; the epitome of gospel-inflected sould jazz with its call-and-response melody and churning beat, was an instant hit that would soon be wideley covered by Woody Herman and many others. (remaster liner notes)</p>
<p>The only other major mention of the character name &quot;Sister Sadie&quot; I know of is mentioned by Nina Simone's performance of &quot;Mississippi Goddamn&quot; (an excellent tune). From <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/2003-04-29/music/nina-simone-1933-2003/"> The Village Voice</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>First of all, her songs, whether covers or original compositions, always privileged the black woman's point of view; they spoke for the dispossessed Sister Sadie who cleaned floors or raised children who would never in their lives again treat black women with respect.</p>
  <p><i>Yes, you lied to me all these years/told me to wash and clean my ears/and talk real fine, just like a lady/and you'd stop calling me <b>Sister Sadie</b>.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<p>I'm not sure who really wrote the first lyrics for Sister Sadie.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sister Sadie was a mean chic, always thought that she was real slick,<br />
    Then she ran into Alfonso Brown, and hasn't been the same since Alfonso put her down.</p>
  <p>Sister Sadie never worry, Sister Sadie never hurry,<br />
    Then she ran into Alfonso Brown, and hasn't been the same since Alfonso put her down.</p>
  <p>She just paces 'round the floor, she don't have no mind no more,<br />
    She just stares off into space, with a frown on her face.</p>
  <p>Sister Sadie was a honey, always had a lot of money,<br />
    Then she ran into Alfonso Brown, and hasn't been the same since Alfonso put her down.</p>
